You will begin this unit by creating a new project for your second Prototype and getting basic player movement working. You will choose:
* a character to represont the player,
* the animals the player will interact with,
* and the food to feed the animals.

Your first coding task will be to give the player basic side-to-side movement using the techniques you learned in Prototype 1, then you will learn to use if-then statements as you keep the Player in bounds.
