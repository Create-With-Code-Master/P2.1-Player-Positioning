# Learning Targets

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Adjust the scale of an object proportionally in order to get it to the size you want
* Employ the ```GetInput()``` function to take user input to control an object
* Create an if-then statement to implement basic logic in your game, including the use of the greater than (>) and less than (<) operators
* Use comments and automatic formatting in order to make your code more consistent and readable to other programmers
